/**
 * Exercise *5.1
 *
 * (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers)
 * Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how
 * many positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and
 * average of the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends with the
 * input 0. Display the average as a floating-point number.
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * Here are sample runs:
 *
 * Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 1 2 â€“1 3 0
 * The number of positives is 3
 * The number of negatives is 1
 * The total is 5.0
 * The average is 1.25
 *
 * Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 0
 * No numbers are entered except 0
 *
